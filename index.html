        <h3>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h3>
        <p>Making sure everything was aligned was probably the most challening part of this assignment. To solve this problem, I looked up documentation online and kept testing things until it worked.</p>

        <h2>Assignment 3 - 11/12/2025</h2>

        <h3>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h3>
        <p>
            Overall, this assignment was much more challenging compared to the first two and it took longer than I expected. One problem I had was with figuring out where to start, and this led me to restart my code once or twice. 
            Another problem I had was with the filtering system. 
            Figuring out how to implement it was a bit of a problem, 
            but also making sure that the right posts were filtered and also that they returned after resetting the filters was a challenge. 
            To solve this, I googled what my problem was until I found a website or Stackoverflow page that helped. 
        </p>

        <h3>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h3>
        <p> 
            I learned a lot about how Javascript works, DOM, and how events can be handled. No special insights come to mind.
            I didn't really find anything that I already knew, as the topics in this assignment were new to me.
        </p>

        <h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
        <p>
            During this assignment, I used the lecture notes the most. For other problems, I looked up documentation, used websites like GeeksforGeeks again, and Stackoverflow.
        </p>

        <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
        <p>
            The two things I remember googling the most were DOM and handling events.
        </p>

    <h2>Assignment 4 - 12/3/2025</h2>

        <h3>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h3>
        <p>
            This assignment was pretty challenging and left me confused at times.
            I ran into multiple problems with this assignment, but off the top of my head, the third part of the assignment, getting npm to work, and syntax errors.
            On the third part of the assignment, I was just a bit confused and it took a little longer than I wanted. 
            Running npm didn't work at first until I switched my VS Code terminal to command prompt.
            For my syntax errors, I went through my code and added proper indentation where it was needed and fixed some misplaced parentheses and apostrophes.
        </p>

        <h3>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h3>
        <p> 
            I learned a lot about dynamic content, ejs, express, and servers. No special insights come to mind, and I didn't find anything I already knew.
        </p>

        <h3>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Campuswire forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h3>
        <p>
            During this assignment, I used the lecture notes extensively, and I also went back to lecture recordings.
            If needed, I would look up EJS questions and EJS documenation. 
        </p>

        <h3>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h3>
        <p>
            I remember having to google EJS and npm related things.
